Livenjet 2026 is a mobile-first infrastructure designed for real-time grid monitoring and automated utility switching in Lagos. This repository houses the 6-pillar core logic and the Guardian AI monitoring system.

---

## 🛡️ The 6-Pillar Core
This architecture is synchronized across the following modules:

1. **Guardian AI (`guardian_ai.js`)**: Real-time system health auditor.
2. **Utility Switch (`utility_switch.js`)**: Logic for automated grid-to-backup migration.
3. **Lagos Grid Core (`lagos_grid_core.js`)**: National grid stability analysis.
4. **Security Protocols (`security_protocols.js`)**: Hardware-bound auth via iPhone Secure Enclave.
5. **UI Controller (`ui_controller.js`)**: Dark Neon dashboard logic for mobile visualization.
6. **Analytics Engine (`analytics_engine.js`)**: Event logging and achievement tracking.

---

## 🚀 Automation & CI/CD
The **Guardian Check** is integrated via GitHub Actions. Every push from the Lagos-Alpha node triggers an automated Linux container to:
* Validate JavaScript syntax across all 6 pillars.
* Verify security handshake logic.

---

## 📡 Live Telemetry
The system is configured to ingest live data from:
* **OpenWeather API**: Hyperlocal Lagos temperature and humidity.
* **Electricity Maps**: Carbon intensity and grid health for Nigeria.
